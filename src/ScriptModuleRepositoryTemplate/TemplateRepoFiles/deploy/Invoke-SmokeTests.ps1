# These tests are runs as part of the deployment process to ensure the newly published module is working as expected.
# These tests run against the installed module, not the source code, so they are a real-world test and should not use mocks.
# Since mocks are not used, be careful to not rely on state stored on the machine, such as a module configuration file.
# This is a great place to put tests that differ between operating systems, since they will be ran on multiple platforms.
# To run these tests on your local machine, see the comments in the BeforeAll block.
