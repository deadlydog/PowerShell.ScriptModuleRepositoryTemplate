# Template PowerShell Script Module Repository

A template repository to create new PowerShell modules from quickly with boilerplate code and CI/CD workflows already defined.

## Template setup instructions

Use this template to create a new repository for your PowerShell module.
Follow the instructions below to get started.

### 📝 Create a new repo from this template

The official docs for creating a new repository from a template can [be found here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
In short, the steps are:

1. Click the `Use this template` button at the top of the repository and choose `Create a new repository`.
1. Name your new repository and give it a description.
1. Click `Create repository`.

### 📦 Add your module

You should now have this repository in your account with the name you chose.

1. Clone your new repository to your local machine.
1. Add your module to the `src` directory.
   1. If you already have a module written:
      1. Add the `.psm1` and `.psd1` files directly to the `src` directory.
      1. Delete the `YourModule.psm1` and `YourModule.psd1` files from the `src` directory.
   1. If you have not written the module yet:
      1. Rename the `YourModule.psm1` and `YourModule.psd1` files in the `src` directory to match your module name.
