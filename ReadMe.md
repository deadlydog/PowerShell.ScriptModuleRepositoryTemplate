# Template PowerShell Script Module Repository

A template repository to create new PowerShell modules quickly with boilerplate files and CI/CD workflows already defined.

## üìÑ Template setup instructions

Use this template to create a new repository for your PowerShell module.
Follow the instructions below to get started.

### üóç Create a new repo from this template

The official docs for creating a new repository from a template can [be found here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
In short, the steps are:

1. Click the `Use this template` button at the top of the repository and choose `Create a new repository`.
1. Name your new repository and give it a description.
1. Click `Create repository`.

You should now have this repository in your account with the name you chose.
Clone it to your local machine to start making changes to it.

### ü§ñ Replace repo template information

Run the [TODO](/TODO.ps1) script to update the repository files with your module's information.
You will be prompted to enter the following information:

- Your modules's name (no spaces)
- Your name or organization name (may contain spaces)

The script will perform a find-and-replace across the entire repository to update the appropriate files with the information you provide.
The script performs the following actions:

- Replaces `YourModuleName` with your module's name.
- Replaces `YourNameOrOrganizationNameHere` with your name or organization name.
- Updates the PowerShell module manifest's `GUID` property with a new unique GUID.

For information that can not be updated automatically, perform the following actions after running the above script:

1. Search for `UPDATE ME` in the repository and update the file accordingly.

### ‚ûï Add your module

If you already have a module written, add the module's `.psm1` and `.psd1` files to the `src` directory, replacing the existing files.

<!-- 1. Add your module to the `src` directory.
   1. If you already have a module written:
      1. Add the `.psm1` and `.psd1` files directly to the `src` directory.
      1. Delete the `YourModuleName.psm1` and `YourModuleName.psd1` files from the `src` directory.
   1. If you have not written the module yet:
      1. Rename the `YourModuleName.psm1` and `YourModuleName.psd1` files in the `src` directory to match your module name.
1. Perform a find-and-replace across the entire repository to replace `YourModuleName` with your module's name (no spaces). -->

### üöÄ Update your CI/CD workflows

This template includes CI/CD workflows for building and publishing the PowerShell module using both GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps Pipelines.
Follow the instructions for the CI/CD system you plan to use.

#### üêôüê± GitHub Actions

If using GitHub Actions for your CI/CD workflows, perform the following steps:

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Azure DevOps Pipelines

If using Azure DevOps Pipelines for your CI/CD pipelines, perform the following steps:

### ‚úî Update boilerplate repo files

The following boilerplate git repository files should be reviewed and updated or removed.

Will require changes:

- [License](/License.md): Update to match your module's license, and ensure it uses the correct name in the copyright.
- [CODEOWNERS](/.github/CODEOWNERS): Update to match your module's maintainers, or remove this file.
- [FUNDING](/.github/FUNDING.yml): Update to match your module's donation information, or remove this file.
- [ReadMe](/ReadMe.md): Update with your module's information.

May require changes:

- Module manifest: Update the module manifest (the `.psd1` file in the `src` directory) with your module's information.
- [Changelog](/Changelog.md): If you don't plan to track a changelog, remove this file and it's reference from the ReadMe.
- [Contributing](/docs/Contributing.md): Update to match your module's contributing guidelines, or remove it.
- [Architectural Decision Records](/docs/ArchitectureDecisionRecords/): Remove this directory if you don't plan to use ADRs, and it's reference from the Contributing page.
- [bug_report](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), [feature_request](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), [pull_request_template](/.github/pull_request_template.md): Update the bug report, feature request, and pull request templates as needed to meet your requirements, or remove them.
- Build and deployment workflows: The workflows include extra steps that you may not want, such as spell check, code coverage, etc.
  Review the workflows and remove any steps that you don't want to include in your CI/CD pipeline.

### üìã Create your own template (optional)

Now that you have the repository looking the way you want, you may want to use it as a template for your future modules so that you don't have to make all of the same changes each time.
In GitHub, from the repo's `Settings` tab under the `General` section, you can rename the repository to reflect that it is a template and check the box to make it a `Template repository`.

The caveat here is you have already ran the script that updated the repository files with your module's name and other information.
In your template repo, you would want to add instructions to do a find-and-replace on the repository files to update the module's name, and any other information you want changed for new modules created from the template.
