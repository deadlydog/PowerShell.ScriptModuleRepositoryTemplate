# These tests are runs as part of the deployment process to ensure the newly published module is working as expected.
# These tests run against the installed module, not the source code, so they do not use mocks and are more of a real-world test.
# Since mocks are not used, we must be careful to not rely on state stored on the machine, such as a module Configuration file.
# To run these tests on your local machine, see the comments in the BeforeAll block.

	# To run these tests on your local machine, comment out the Import-Module command above and uncomment the one below.
	# 	Do this to use the module version from source code, not the installed version.
	# 	This is necessary to test functionality that you've added to the module, but have not yet published and installed.
